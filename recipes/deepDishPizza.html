        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 &frac14; teaspoons of <strong>active dry yeast</strong></li>
            <li>1 &frac12; teaspoons of <strong>white sugar</strong></li>
            <li>1 &frac18; cups of <strong>warm water</strong> - 110 to 115 degrees F</li>
            <li>3 cups of <strong>all-purpose flour</strong></li>
            <li>&frac12; cup of <strong>corn oil</strong></li>
            <li>1 &frac12; teaspoon of <strong>kosher salt</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong> as needed, for greasing</li>
        </ul>    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine yeast mixture, flour, corn oil, and kosher salt in a large stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; knead until dough holds together but is still slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Form dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl. Turn to coat dough with butter, then cover the bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Press dough into a 10-inch deep-dish pizza pan and follow your pizza recipe.</li>
        </ol>
